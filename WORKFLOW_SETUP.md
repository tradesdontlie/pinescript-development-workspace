## 🚀 What's Been Set Up

### ✅ 1. Repository Organization
- **56 Pine Script files** organized into proper categories
- **All indicators** moved from cursor-memory-bank to main structure
- **Libraries and strategies** properly categorized
- **Version control** with clean commit history

### ✅ 2. GitHub Project Management
- **Issue templates** for bug reports, feature requests, and indicator development
- **Pull request template** with testing checklist
- **Labels created** for categorization (indicator, fvg, ghost, oracle, priority-high)
- **Starter issues created** to demonstrate workflow

### ✅ 3. Team Workflow Ready
- **Contributing guide** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) for team members
- **Project management guide** for you as project manager
- **Clear branching strategy** and PR process defined

## 🎮 How to Use This System

### For You (Project Manager):

1. **Create Issues** for tasks:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "[INDICATOR] Task description" --body "Details..." --label "indicator,priority-high"
   ```

2. **Assign Issues** to team members:
   ```bash
   gh issue edit 1 --add-assignee username
   ```

3. **Review Pull Requests** when team members submit work:
   - Check code quality
   - Test functionality
   - Approve or request changes

### For Team Members:

1. **Pick up assigned issues** from the repository
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/indicator-enhancement`
3. **Make changes** and commit
4. **Create pull request** using the template
5. **Wait for your review** and approval

## 📊 Current Issues Created (Examples)

1. **[FVG] Add weekly timeframe filter** - Enhancement task
2. **[GHOST] Fix T1 calculation bug** - Bug fix task  
3. **[ORACLE] Implement signal confidence scoring** - Feature request

## 🔧 Next Steps for Your Team

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Invite team members** to the repository
2. **Assign the existing issues** to specific developers
3. **Set up team communication** (Discord, Slack, etc.)

### Team Member Onboarding:
1. Share the repository link
2. Have them read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. Assign their first issue
4. Walk them through the PR process

## 🛡️ Branch Protection (Manual Setup Required)

Since you have a private repository, you'll need to manually set up branch protection:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Branches** in your GitHub repo
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Set branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require review from code owners
   - ✅ Dismiss stale PR reviews when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging

## 📝 Commands for Daily Management

### Create New Issues:
```bash
# Feature request
gh issue create --title "[INDICATOR] Feature name" --body "Description" --label "indicator,priority-medium"

# Bug report  
gh issue create --title "[INDICATOR] Bug description" --body "Details" --label "indicator,priority-high"

# Assign to team member
gh issue edit ISSUE_NUMBER --add-assignee USERNAME
```

### Monitor Progress:
```bash
# List all open issues
gh issue list

# View specific issue
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER

# List pull requests
gh pr list

# Review pull request
gh pr review PULL_NUMBER
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure team productivity:
- **Issues created vs closed** per week
- **Pull request turnaround time**
- **Code review quality**
- **Bug detection rate**
