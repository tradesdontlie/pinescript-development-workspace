## Step 6: Team Onboarding Process

### For Each New Team Member:

1. **Add to repository** with Write access
2. **Add to project** as member
3. **Send them this onboarding checklist**:

#### Team Member Onboarding Checklist
- [ ] GitHub account setup and repository access confirmed
- [ ] Read `HOW_TO_USE.md` for quick start guide
- [ ] Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development guidelines
- [ ] Understand signal classification system (bias/momentum/execution/confluence)
- [ ] Learn TTS integration requirements
- [ ] Set up TradingView account (Pro/Premium recommended)
- [ ] Install VS Code with Pine Script extension (optional)
- [ ] Complete first assignment (start with simple data point)

### First Assignment Process:

1. **Create a simple starter issue** for new team members:
   ```
   Title: [STARTER] Add RSI-based bias filter to FVG indicator
   
   Description: This is a starter task to learn our workflow.
   
   **Task**: Add a simple RSI bias filter to the FVG indicator that:
   - Uses RSI(14) to determine bias
   - RSI < 50 = bearish bias (-1)
   - RSI > 50 = bullish bias (+1)
   - Integrates with TTS framework
   
   **Learning Goals**:
   - Practice using issue templates
   - Learn working/ directory development
   - Understand TTS integration
   - Experience PR review process
   ```

2. **Assign to new team member**
3. **Provide mentoring** during their first contribution
4. **Give detailed feedback** on first PR

## Step 7: Daily/Weekly Workflow

### Your Role as Project Manager:

#### Daily Tasks (5-10 minutes):
1. **Review new issues** in Backlog
2. **Approve and assign** ready items to team members
3. **Check PR reviews** and provide feedback
4. **Update project status** as needed

#### Weekly Tasks (30 minutes):
1. **Team sync meeting** to discuss progress
2. **Review project board** and adjust priorities
3. **Plan next week's assignments**
4. **Update documentation** if needed

### Team Member Daily Workflow:

1. **Check assigned issues** in project board
2. **Update status** when starting work (move to "In Progress")
3. **Work in working/ directory** following guidelines
4. **Submit PR** when ready (auto-moves to "Review")
5. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

## Step 8: Using the Project Board

### Project Board Views:

#### Table View (Primary)
- **Best for**: Managing assignments, seeing all details
- **Use for**: Daily management, assigning work, tracking progress

#### Board View (Secondary) 
- **Best for**: Visual workflow, sprint planning
- **Use for**: Team meetings, progress visualization

### Filtering and Sorting:
- **Filter by**: Assignee, Status, Type, Priority
- **Sort by**: Priority, Created date, Updated date
- **Group by**: Status, Assignee, Type

## Step 9: Issue Template Workflow

### For Data Point Requests:
1. **Team member** creates issue using "Data Point Request" template
2. **You review** and add labels (data-point, priority, category)
3. **If approved**: Assign to developer, move to "To Do"
4. **If needs more info**: Add comments, keep in "Backlog"

### For Strategy Model Requests:
1. **Team member** creates issue using "Strategy Model" template
2. **You review** dependencies (are all required indicators available?)
3. **If dependencies missing**: Create data point issues first
4. **If ready**: Assign to strategy developer, move to "To Do"

## Step 10: Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure project success:

### Weekly Metrics:
- **Issues created**: New requests from team
- **Issues completed**: Finished data points/strategies
- **PR review time**: How fast reviews happen
- **Team participation**: How many team members contributing

### Monthly Metrics:
- **Signal quality**: Backtesting results of new signals
- **Code quality**: Compilation errors, review feedback
- **Team satisfaction**: Regular feedback sessions
- **Project velocity**: Items completed per sprint

## Step 11: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If team members aren't using templates:
- **Solution**: Make templates mandatory, provide training

### If PRs sit too long in review:
- **Solution**: Set review time expectations (24-48 hours)

### If too many conflicts in working/:
- **Solution**: Better coordination, smaller feature branches

### If signal quality is poor:
- **Solution**: Stricter review criteria, more testing requirements
